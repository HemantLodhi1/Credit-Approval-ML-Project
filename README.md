# Credit-Approval-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict credit card approval decisions based on various factors such as income, gender, car ownership, and property ownership
The project includes data analysis, hypothesis testing, and the application of machine learning algorithms. SQL queries are also used for data manipulation and analysis
Also including some sql analysis

Project Introduction: The document outlines the project proposal to predict credit card approval using data analysis and machine learning approaches1.
Questions, Hypothesis, and Approach: The document specifies the questions to answer, the initial hypotheses about the data relationships, and the data analysis approach to test the hypotheses2.
Data Description: The document provides information about the data variables, such as Ind_ID, Gender, Car_owner, Property_owner, etc3. The data also includes a label indicating whether the credit card application was approved or rejected.
SQL Queries: The document lists some SQL queries to perform on the data, such as finding the average annual income by income type, the female owners of cars and property, the top five people with the highest income, etc.
